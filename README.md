1.	Project Setup:
o	Create a new project directory.
o	Initialize necessary project files and dependencies.
o	Establish a basic project structure separating front-end and back-end components.
2.	Back-End Development:
o	Design a simple data model for to-do items (e.g., id, text, isCompleted).
o	Set up a database and create a table to store to-do items.
o	Build a RESTful API with endpoints to:
	Create a new to-do item (POST)
	Retrieve all to-do items (GET)
	Retrieve a specific to-do item (GET /api/todos/:id)
	Update a specific to-do item (PUT/PATCH /api/todos/:id)
	Delete a specific to-do item (DELETE /api/todos/:id)
3.	Front-End Development:
o	Design a user-friendly interface for the to-do list.
o	Implement the form for creating new tasks.
o	Display the fetched list of tasks.
o	Build edit and delete buttons/functionality for each task.
o	Use JavaScript to make API calls for performing CRUD operations.
4.	Integration:
o	Ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end using your RESTful API.
